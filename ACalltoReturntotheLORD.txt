Deuteronomy 30:1-10
In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the LORD your God has exiled you, take to heart all these instructions. 
If at that time you and your children return to the LORD your God, and if you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes. 
He will have mercy on you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you. 
Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth, the LORD your God will gather you from there and bring you back again. 
The LORD your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will possess that land again. 
Then he will make you even more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors!
The LORD your God will change your heart and the hearts of all your descendants, so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live! 
The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you. 
Then you will again obey the LORD and keep all his commands that I am giving you today. 
The LORD your God will then make you successful in everything you do. 
He will give you many children and numerous livestock, and he will cause your fields to produce abundant harvests, for the LROD will again delight in being good to you as he was to your ancestors. 
The LORD your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
